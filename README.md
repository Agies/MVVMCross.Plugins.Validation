Validation Plug-in for MVVMCross
-------------------------------

So far we are supporting only MonoDroid, I plan on adding support for MonoTouch very soon. Unfortunately, do to the way the PCL behaves, I couldn't roll in any other validation libraries. I am sure it is possible, I ran into a wall and needed to back some stuff out, so I created a new annotation framework :p.
